# App

## Setup
Install vscode and the `Flutter` extension.  
Install git.  
In your desired directory run:
```
git clone https://github.com/HSMA-Adeptus-Mechanicus/app.git
cd app
```
This will clone the repository into the app directory and navigate into it.

On Windows run `explorer .` to open the directory in the explorer.  
If vscode is in your `PATH` you can also use `code .` to open the directory directly in vscode.

## Rules
- Do not push into the branch `main`.
- When committing or pushing first check if the current branch is correct.

## Merge to main checklist
- The code has to be commented
- The code has to be tested
- Merge `main` into the other branch
- Create pull request into `main` branch
- All checks have to pass
- Review by another person
